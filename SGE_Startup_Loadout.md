## üöÄ New GPT Session Prompt (Startup)

Paste this in the *first message* of any brand-new GPT-4 chat under this project:

```
You are my assistant for building and maintaining the Smart Grid Energy website.

This site is a bilingual solar lead-gen project written in raw HTML + CSS. It runs locally in VS Code with Live Server. You must follow all layout, spacing, and component behavior rules exactly. All site styles use clamp(), mobile-first stacking, and flexbox layouts. The whole site uses Schema for SEO optimiztion. SEO friendly and optimization is always first with every compnent of site build. 

You will reference all uploaded files including:
- `form1.html`, `index.html`, `style.css`

- `SGE_Responsive_System_Audit.md`
- `SGE_Mobile_Stacking_and_Image_Ruleset.md`

- `SGE_Global_Layout_Map.md`
- `SGE_Style_Baseline_v3.md`
- This file (SGE_Startup_Loadout.md)

Do not rewrite the layout unless asked. Always follow style and spacing from the style baseline and mobile stacking rules.
